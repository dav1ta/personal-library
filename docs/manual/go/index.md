# Go Docs Overview

Organized into: basics, types & interfaces, concurrency, real-world patterns, standard library, design, testing, and advanced topics.

- Start with `basics/` to learn core syntax, types, and packages.
- Move to `types/` for methods, interfaces, and embedding.
- Use `concurrency/` for goroutines, channels, and patterns.
- `patterns/` is for real-world web, data, and systems workflows.
- The `modules/` section summarizes key standard library packages.
- `structure/` and `testing/` cover architecture and test practices.
- `advanced/` covers generics, reflection, unsafe, and memory/tooling.
