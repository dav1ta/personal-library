# System Design Notes (Outline)

A short outline of key topics to study or reference.

## Fundamentals
- Networking basics (HTTP/TCP/UDP, DNS, load balancing)
- Caching strategies and eviction
- Databases (SQL vs NoSQL, indexing)
- Consistency models and transactions

## Scalability
- Horizontal scaling + stateless services
- Sharding and partitioning
- Read replicas and CQRS
- Queues and background workers

## Reliability
- Timeouts, retries, circuit breakers
- Failover and multi-region
- Backups and disaster recovery

## Security
- AuthN/AuthZ, least privilege
- Secrets management
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

## Observability
- Metrics, logs, traces
- SLOs/SLAs

## Design Interview Flow (Short)
1. Requirements and constraints.
2. High-level architecture.
3. Data model and scaling plan.
4. Bottlenecks and failure modes.
5. Trade-offs and next steps.
