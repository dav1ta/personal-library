## API

1. **Question:** What are the fundamental principles of RESTful architecture?  
   **Answer:** REST relies on statelessness, a client-server separation, cacheability, a uniform interface, and a layered system to promote scalable and maintainable web services.

2. **Question:** How does REST differ from SOAP in terms of design and performance?  
   **Answer:** REST is lightweight and uses standard HTTP methods with flexible data formats (JSON, XML), while SOAP is protocol-heavy, strictly defined with XML, and often slower due to its complexity.

3. **Question:** Which HTTP methods are commonly used in REST APIs, and what is the purpose of each?  
   **Answer:** GET (retrieve), POST (create), PUT (update/replace), PATCH (update/modify partially), and DELETE (remove). These methods align with CRUD operations for resources.

4. **Question:** How do you design a stateless REST API and why is statelessness important?  
   **Answer:** Ensure each request contains all necessary context (usually via tokens or headers) and avoid server-side sessions. Statelessness simplifies scaling and improves reliability.

5. **Question:** What are the best practices for error handling in REST API responses?  
   **Answer:** Use standardized HTTP status codes, provide clear error messages, include error codes, and avoid leaking internal details.

6. **Question:** How can you implement versioning in a REST API without breaking existing clients?  
   **Answer:** Use URL versioning (e.g., /v1/resource), header versioning, or media type versioning to maintain backward compatibility.

7. **Question:** What are the advantages of using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication?  
   **Answer:** JWTs are stateless, self-contained, and easily scalable, enabling decentralized validation without server-side session storage.

8. **Question:** How does JWT authentication work in a typical web application?  
   **Answer:** Upon login, the server issues a signed token containing user claims; the client sends this token with subsequent requests for stateless verification.

9. **Question:** What are the security considerations when using JWT for user authentication?  
   **Answer:** Protect the signing key, use secure algorithms, set appropriate expiration, and consider token revocation strategies to mitigate misuse.

10. **Question:** How can you mitigate risks such as token theft or replay attacks in JWT authentication?  
    **Answer:** Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, set short expiration times, and implement token blacklisting or refresh mechanisms.

11. **Question:** What is the process for handling JWT expiration and refresh tokens?  
    **Answer:** Issue short-lived access tokens and longer-lived refresh tokens; when the access token expires, use the refresh token to obtain a new one.

12. **Question:** How do OAuth2 and JWT differ in terms of authentication and authorization?  
    **Answer:** OAuth2 is a framework for delegated authorization, while JWT is a token format often used within OAuth2 flows to convey claims securely.

85. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `__slots__` attribute in Python classes?  
    **Answer:** `__slots__` restricts dynamic creation of instance attributes, saving memory and potentially improving attribute access speed.

86. **Question:** How do you manage large-scale Python projects?  
    **Answer:** Use virtual environments, modular package structures, clear coding standards (like PEP 8), version control, and comprehensive testing to maintain scalable codebases.

87. **Question:** What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Python?  
    **Answer:** Synchronous programming executes tasks sequentially, while asynchronous programming (using `asyncio`) allows concurrent execution of I/O-bound tasks without blocking the main thread.

88. **Question:** How do you integrate Python with databases?  
    **Answer:** Use libraries like `sqlite3` for lightweight databases, or ORMs like SQLAlchemy or Django ORM for complex database interactions and abstraction.

89. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `subprocess` module in Python?  
    **Answer:** The `subprocess` module allows you to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and manage their execution from within Python.

90. **Question:** How do you handle file paths in a cross-platform manner in Python?  
    **Answer:** Use the `os.path` module or `pathlib` library to handle file system paths, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems.

91. **Question:** What is the role of the `socket` module in Python?  
    **Answer:** The `socket` module provides low-level networking interfaces, enabling the creation of clients and servers for communication over networks.

92. **Question:** How do you perform web scraping in Python?  
    **Answer:** Use libraries like `requests` to fetch web pages and `BeautifulSoup` or `lxml` to parse HTML and extract information.

93. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `asyncio` module?  
    **Answer:** `asyncio` facilitates writing concurrent code using async/await syntax, enabling efficient management of I/O-bound and high-level structured network code.

94. **Question:** How do you create RESTful APIs using Python?  
    **Answer:** Use frameworks like Flask or Django REST Framework to quickly build and deploy RESTful APIs with routing, authentication, and serialization support.

95. **Question:** What is the difference between Flask and Django?  
    **Answer:** Flask is a lightweight, microframework offering flexibility and minimalism, while Django is a full-featured framework providing built-in components for rapid development.

96. **Question:** How do you handle middleware in Python web frameworks?  
    **Answer:** Middleware in frameworks like Django or Flask extensions intercepts requests and responses, allowing for logging, authentication, and other cross-cutting concerns.

97. **Question:** How can you deploy Python applications in production?  
    **Answer:** Deploy using WSGI servers like Gunicorn or uWSGI, combined with web servers (e.g., Nginx) and containerization (Docker) for scalability and reliability.

98. **Question:** What are Python's best practices for error logging in production?  
    **Answer:** Use structured logging with the `logging` module, integrate with centralized logging systems, and avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.

99. **Question:** How do you keep Python code maintainable and scalable?  
    **Answer:** Follow coding standards (PEP 8), modularize code, write tests, use version control, document thoroughly, and refactor when necessary.

100. **Question:** What are the future trends in Python development?  
     **Answer:** Expect enhanced performance with projects like PyPy and Cython, increased use of async programming, growing adoption in data science and machine learning, and continued improvements in type checking and code maintainability.
