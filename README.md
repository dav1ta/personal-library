# Elibrary Docs

This documentation covers Python, Docker, FastAPI, Kubernetes, and more.

## Structure and Navigation
- Each major section (e.g., python, kubernetes, docker) is a top-level folder.
- Major folders use `index.md` or an overview at the top.

## Conventions
- Folder and file names: lowercase, use underscores if needed
- Fixed typos (network, maintenance, scheduler)
- Brief overviews at start of sections
- See OpenCode.md for code/test style guidelines

## Getting Started
- Build docs: `mkdocs build`
- Serve: `mkdocs serve`
- Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
